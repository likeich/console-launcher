### Creating Platforms
The easiest way to make platforms is to use the "Auto-Create Platforms" menu. Here, you can select the folder that holds your platform folders. Example: select your "ROM" folder that holds folders of games such as "PSP", "PS2", "Sega Saturn", etc. Console Launcher will create platforms for each folder it finds.

You can also create folders manually in the "All Platforms" menu.

### Media Scraping Tips
Media scraping in Console Launcher uses the title of your games and their set systems to find their box arts and other information. If a game is not scraped correctly, try renaming the game in Console Launcher. Finding the box art manually is also possible using the Shortcut Editor menu.

A game file is uniquely identified by using its file path and file name. This means that if the file is moved or renamed, its settings will disappear. However, custom images are saved based on the filename and will be used regardless of file location.

### Multi-Disc/File Support
Game files with similar names will be grouped. When launched, Console Launcher will show a dialog that lets you select the file you would like to open. If you have games with multiple discs, these will be grouped along with game files that differ by their extension. For example, \'game.nds\' and \'game.zip\' will be grouped.

The game file selection dialog can generate an M3U playlist if the current Player supports it. This file groups game discs together and allows them to be launched as one game. This is useful for games that require multiple discs to be played. RetroArch is a notable app that can play M3U files. More information about M3U files can be found below.
